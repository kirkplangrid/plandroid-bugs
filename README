An intern comes to you with this branch.
They tell you that they're trying to add a dialog that lets you change the roles of users. They say
"This should work! It actually does sort of work if you cold-restart the app... I don't know what to do, can you help?"

Gently pick through their code and figure out 1. what's wrong and 2. any other improvements.

Cheers!
